    <h1>About This Map Thing</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to my unofficial, totally homemade guide for NYUAD students who suddenly find themselves in New York.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website is basically a collection of tiny memories, helpful discoveries, accidental
      adventures, and “oh wow, I wish someone told me this earlier” moments.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use This Space</h2>

    <p>
      If you’re also studying away in New York right now, feel free to add your own monents! Just...
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>🗽 Keep it helpful</strong><br>
      Add spots you think other students might appreciate — cozy cafés, quiet study corners, cheap eats, random places
      that made you happy, anything you wish you knew earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>🗽 Keep it decent</strong><br>
      When you comment, be kind, be useful, and don’t be weird in a bad way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>🗽 Keep it relevant</strong><br>
      Please only add moments if you’re actually studying away. This is meant for current NYUAD folks
      trying to survive New York, not a general tourism board.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>🗽 Keep it fun</strong><br>
      This isn’t a serious city guide. It’s more like group therapy for confused students trying to survive the MTA.
    </p>

      Have fun!!!!
