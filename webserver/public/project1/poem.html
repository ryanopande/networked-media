    <h1>I did not write any poems in Paris</h1>
    
    <div class="poem">
Only sat and sipped Prosecco by the Seine, watched riverboats, dipped macaroons into steaming mugs of coffee, stared wide-eyed at the eiffel tower at midnight. I did not pick up a pen, but I did pick up pastries, grinned at gargoyles, smiled at the Mona Lisa, I did not describe the world as much as taste it.
And then - like a child, I opened up my greedy fists and begged for more.
Paris, je t'aime.
